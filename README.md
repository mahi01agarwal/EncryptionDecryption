# EncryptionDecryption
## Description
This is a simple encryption-decryption project that takes message and applies six different ciphers in a random order to encrypt the message.

The six ciphers used in this project are:

- Hill Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher
- Affine Cipher
- Permutation Cipher
- Shift Cipher
- Substitution Cipher

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <https://github.com/mahi01agarwal/EncryptionDecryption.git>`.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Run the `Encryption.py` file.

4. The program will apply the ciphers in a random order to encrypt your message and will store the encrypted message in encrypt.txt fie.

5. To Decrypt the message run `Decryption.py`.



## Ciphers

The Ciphers used in this project are all modified to make them a bit more secure.


 ## Disclaimer

Please note that the ciphers used in this project are not secure enough for sensitive information and should only be used for educational or experimental purposes.
